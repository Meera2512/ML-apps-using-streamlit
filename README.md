# ML-apps-using-streamlit
Connecting a classification/prediction model built using machine learning  to streamlit. 
This is a basic demo of how we can present our Machine learning code using streamlit. This project is about predicting loan defauters, base on several features in the dataset .
Steps performed:1. Writing the full code using python editor and save it as .py 2.run the python file using "streamlit run pythonfilename.py" command
